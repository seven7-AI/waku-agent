"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL, THIRD TIER -- the two images, built and run.

Task C1 of spec 001. What this file proves, and what it does not:

  IT PROVES, by reading the BUILT IMAGE and the RUNNING CONTAINER:
    - each image's /app holds what its Dockerfile COPYs and nothing more --
      asserted in BOTH directions, because a listing test with only negations
      passes on an empty listing and with the COPY lines deleted
    - that the per-Dockerfile allowlist is READ AT ALL, by planting a
      secret-shaped file inside an admitted tree and watching it stay out
      while its non-secret sibling arrives
    - under a read-only root, with only /data, /work and a 256 MB tmpfs /tmp
      writable, a full turn, a settings save and a SQL console query all
      succeed (design section 10.6)
    - the container's writable layer is untouched after those three
    - the .env the tenant reads is the one in /work, by saving through the
      dashboard and reading the host side of the mount back

  IT DOES NOT PROVE anything about the Dockerfile's or the ignore file's TEXT.
  That is evals/deterministic/hosted/test_image_context.py, which is a DRIFT
  CHECK on the allowlist's shape and says so. Asserting an exclude string
  instead of the built artefact is the defect this spec has now found five
  times; the assertions below read `docker run ... ls -a`.

EVERY TEST HERE IS UNEXECUTED as of task C1: this machine has Docker 28.0.4
installed and no daemon running. C4 brings the job that runs them, and its
first green run is this file's first evidence.

    tenant.Dockerfile.dockerignore is deleted, neutered or never read.

    The allowlist admits whole trees -- `!waku/`, `!skills/` -- so nothing in
    the top-level listing can tell you whether a secret INSIDE one of them got
    in. This plants exactly that: waku/_c1_context_probe/ with a README.txt,
    seven secrets the ignore file refuses, and three it does not.

    WHAT IT PROVES, in three assertions, none of which is enough alone:

      README.txt MUST be there -- otherwise the whole probe directory failed to
      reach the image (a stale cache, a typo in the path, a COPY that does not
      cover it) and every absence below proves nothing. This is the presence
      assertion that stops the test passing vacuously.

      CONTEXT_PROBE_REFUSED must be absent -- `**/.*`, `**/*.pem` and
      `**/*.key`, below the `!` admissions where last-match-wins makes them
      count. `.netrc`, `.npmrc` and the `.aws` DIRECTORY are in that tuple
      because a review planted exactly those against an earlier version that
      named only `.env` and `.env.*`, and got seven green tests.

      the listing must EQUAL README.txt plus CONTEXT_PROBE_GETS_THROUGH --
      no more and no less. This is the honest half. id_rsa, credentials.json
      and server.p12 DO enter the image, because nothing here can tell a
      secret from a config file by its name and there is no allowlist version
      of this rule: whole trees are what the ignore file admits. Pinning the
      survivors exactly means the limit is written down and visible, a NEW
      shape getting through turns this red, and tightening the rule later also
      turns it red -- which is correct, because that is an edit to a stated
      security boundary and it should not happen quietly.

    COST NOTE, CORRECTED. An earlier version of this docstring said this build
    is "close to a cache hit on top of the session's tenant_image". It is not.
    tenant.Dockerfile does `COPY waku ./waku` BEFORE `RUN uv sync --frozen
    --extra notion`, so planting waku/_c1_context_probe/ changes the COPY
    layer's hash and invalidates every layer after it -- including a full cold
    `uv sync` of the whole lock, over the network. That is the largest single
    item in the hosted-docker job's budget after the two first builds, and
    `timeout-minutes: 30` is not generous with it there.

    It is still worth it: this is the only test in C1 that fails if the
    per-Dockerfile ignore file is deleted or neutered. But if the job starts
    timing out, this is the first place to look, and the fix is to move the
    COPY of waku/ after the sync rather than to drop the test.

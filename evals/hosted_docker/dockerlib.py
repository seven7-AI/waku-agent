"""The Docker CLI, wrapped, for the third eval tier.

WHY THE CLI AND NOT THE ENGINE API. hosted/spawner/ talks to the Engine API
with aiohttp because the spec says so and because a service should not depend
on a CLI being installed. A test harness is the other case: it has to BUILD
images, which the Engine API does not do in any small way, and it is read by
people debugging a red CI job, who will paste the command into their own shell.
So hosted/ uses the API and evals/hosted_docker/ uses the CLI, and neither
borrows the other's mechanism.

THE THREE OUTCOMES. A Docker test that passes because the container never
started is worse than no test. Every function here keeps the three apart:

  no daemon      -> daemon_version() returns None, and conftest.py skips the
                    whole directory with the daemon's own message
  a broken build -> build_image RAISES DockerError with the build log's tail;
                    it never skips, because a build that does not build is a
                    finding, not an environment
  a healthy run  -> the assertion in the test decides

and wait_for_listener adds the fourth: a probe target that never came up fails
the test BEFORE any assertion about the thing under test, so "A cannot reach B"
can never pass because B was not listening.

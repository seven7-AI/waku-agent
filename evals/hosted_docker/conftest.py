"""Skip this whole directory when there is nothing here to run it on.

TWO REASONS TO SKIP, AND NEITHER IS A FAILURE:

  hosted/ is absent    -- the sdist ships evals/ and excludes "/hosted"
                          (pyproject.toml), exactly as
                          evals/deterministic/hosted/conftest.py handles
  the daemon is absent -- Docker may be installed with nothing running, which
                          is the state of the maintainers' machines most of the
                          time. Checked on macOS 25.6.0 with Docker 28.0.4
                          installed and Docker Desktop stopped: `docker version
                          --format '{{.Server.Version}}'` exits 1 with empty
                          stdout, in under a second, with no hang.

ONE REASON THAT IS NOT A SKIP: a build that fails. dockerlib.build_image raises
DockerError with the build log, because the daemon answered -- so the
environment is fine and the Dockerfile is not.

This directory is the THIRD eval tier. It is offline, like evals/deterministic,
but it needs a Docker daemon, so `make gate` does not run it
(waku/ops/release_gate.py runs the suites "deterministic" and "judge" and only
those) and neither do the two workflows that run evals/deterministic. Its own
job, `hosted-docker`, is in .github/workflows/hosted-docker.yml.

            runs as the runner's unprivileged user, so an in-process

            CAP_SYS_ADMIN, the Docker socket and the data device. Testing it
            any other way tests a configuration nothing ships.

        <root>/run/spawner is a bind mount, so the Unix socket the service
        binds inside the container appears on the HOST, and the tests talk to
        it with hosted.jsonsock.ask -- the same client the gateway will use.

        `tenant_image` is requested and unused on purpose: the spawner starts
        tenant containers by tag, so the tag has to exist before the first
        start, and a fixture that builds it is how that is guaranteed rather
        than hoped.

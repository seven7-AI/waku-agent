"""What install.sh actually builds, read back from the kernel and the daemon.

FOUR THINGS ONLY ROOT AND A DAEMON CAN ANSWER:
  - a directory's real owner and mode, after a chown to a UID this machine has
    no user for;
  - whether a bridge really carries enable_icc=false and the right IPAM;
  - whether UID 10003 can open control.db (acceptance 20);
  - whether a tenant container outranks every service for the OOM killer
    (acceptance 16's last clause).

THE WHOLE INSTALL IS NOT RUN HERE. install.sh apt-installs packages, builds
three images and starts Caddy, which would reach out to Let's Encrypt with
credentials this runner does not have. Running it end to end is recorded check
F1-R1, on the VM. What runs here are the two pieces that change the machine --
tree.sh and networks.sh -- plus the two kernel facts the Compose stack's users
and oom_score_adj exist for.

THIS MODULE DESTROYS THE TWO BRIDGES. `test_networks_sh_creates_both_bridges_
with_icc_off` removes `waku-tenants` and `waku-inspect` before it runs and
again in a `finally`, because the thing under test is what `networks.sh`
CREATES and a bridge that is already there would make the script's own
idempotence path hide it. On a host carrying a live deployment that takes the
tenant bridge out from under every running tenant container. Run this tier on
a CI runner or a scratch VM, never on the VM serving tenants -- which is what
`.github/workflows/hosted-docker.yml` does and why it is a job of its own.

WHAT MOVED OUT OF THIS FILE, and why. The plan's step 13 put the
`docker compose config` assertions here. They need the Compose CLI and no
daemon, so they live in evals/deterministic/hosted/test_deploy_scripts.py
instead: `hosted-docker` is advisory until Sean adds it to branch protection
(status.md open question 2), and the four services' users, mounts and
oom_score_adj are exactly the fields that must not be able to regress through
a required check. The one compose assertion that does need a daemon -- that a
tenant container's oom_score_adj is ABOVE the services' -500 -- is still here.

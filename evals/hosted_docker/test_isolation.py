"""Acceptance 2 and acceptance 16, against a real kernel.

C3 OWNS THIS FILE and writes the NETWORK half -- the bridges, the firewall, the
six counted drops, the host's ports, the socket directories. C3 was DEFERRED by
a scope decision, so C2 creates the file with its own half and edits nothing:
when C3 lands it appends, the same way it would have if the order had held.

WHAT IS HERE: the environment-and-files half of acceptance 2 (the platform key
is in no tenant container) and acceptance 16's disk, seccomp and FTW_PHYS
cases. Every one of them reads the kernel's own answer or tries the thing the
field is supposed to prevent; none reads a dict.

    here rather than waiting for C3.

    A tenant's dashboard has NO AUTHENTICATION of its own -- the gateway in
    front of it is the whole of it -- and a user-defined Docker bridge allows
    container-to-container traffic by DEFAULT. So with ICC on, tenant A opens
    TCP to 10.88.0.<B>:7777 and reads tenant B's chat log, memory and SQL
    console. `enable_icc=false` in core/tenant.BRIDGE_OPTIONS is what closes
    it, and this is the test that tries the connection.

    THE CONTROL IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS, and it takes TWO probes, not one.
    `probe_tcp` returning False is also what a broken prober, a dead container,
    a dashboard that never bound and a container that never joined the network
    look like.

      - 127.0.0.1:7777 proves the prober works and the dashboard is up. It
        does NOT prove the container is on the tenant bridge at all: a
        container with no route off its own loopback passes it and then passes
        every cross-tenant assertion below for the wrong reason.
      - TENANT_GATEWAY:<a port the host is listening on> proves the container's
        OFF-LOOPBACK networking works. ICC is documented not to block the
        bridge gateway -- deliberately, because that is where the proxy will
        listen on 10.88.0.1:8788 -- so this is the one route that must still
        work after enable_icc=false, and the one D1 depends on.

    With both, "A cannot reach B" becomes "A's off-container networking works
    and still cannot reach B".

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, and nothing on this branch does: the DOCKER-USER
    forward rules, the dropped link-local, CGNAT and private ranges, the DNS
    exception, the host's INPUT rules, and the inspect bridge's egress. All of
    those are C3's firewall.sh and C3 is deferred. A green run here means
    tenant A cannot reach tenant B ON THE BRIDGE; it does not mean a tenant
    container is confined to it.

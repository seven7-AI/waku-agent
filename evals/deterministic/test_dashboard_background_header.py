"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the dashboard tells a timer's poll from a person.

A hosted tenant's container stops when the tenant is idle, and that only
works if "idle" is honest. The dashboard used to poll /api/data every 5s and
/api/events every 450ms unconditionally, tab hidden or not — an open
background tab kept a container alive forever. `X-Waku-Background: 1` is how
the frontend now marks a request as a timer's poll rather than a person doing
something (group E's hosted gateway reads it to decide whether the request
counts as activity).

There is no browser in CI and no JS test runner (static/README.md — on
purpose), so this is a text-level guard, not a behavioural one. It cannot
watch the Network tab; only Sean's browser check (task-A3-brief.md step 6)
does that. What it CAN catch, offline and every run, is the regression that
actually matters months from now: someone adds a new `setInterval(...)` poll,
or a new fetch inside one of the functions that a poll already reaches, and
forgets the header — silently making a tenant's container immortal again.

WHAT THIS GUARD IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. Read this before trusting it.

It walks five tokens — `fetch`, `postJSON`, `setInterval`, `setTimeout` and
`paused` — in every file under js/, and requires each occurrence to resolve
to a site declared in this file. What it reads is each token's RECOGNISED
FORM: a call (`fetch(`, `setInterval(`, whitespace before the paren
allowed) and a plain assignment (`paused = false`). Within those forms it
is exhaustive, and an undeclared site fails whatever shape the surrounding
code is written in — which is what catches the poller built from two levels
of indirection, the one bound to a const as an arrow, and the one that
reschedules itself with setTimeout, three shapes that walked through the
first version of this file, which tried to enumerate what a poller looks
like instead.

Written any OTHER way, those same five tokens are caught by named shape
rather than by the walk: a network function taken as a value
(`const _f = fetch`, `const _pj = postJSON`), re-bound, reached through the
global object, renamed in an object pattern, or called through optional
chaining (`globalThis?.fetch?.()`); and `paused` written by a compound
assignment (`paused &&= false`), by `++`/`--`, or by destructuring
(`({paused} = {paused: false})`). Those lists are named shapes, not a
closure — the honest way to read this file is that the walk is exhaustive
over the recognised forms and everything else is a blocklist.

It is NOT a proof that the dashboard cannot make an unmarked request. "What
makes a request in a browser" is not a closed set, and there is no AST
here: this is text matching over JavaScript, deliberately, because
static/README.md rules out a build step and a JS test runner and the core
takes no new dependency. test_dashboard_routes.py can walk Python's `ast`
and genuinely close its set; this file cannot, and an earlier version of
this paragraph claimed it did while four live pollers went through.

So the other transports are denied BY NAME too — XMLHttpRequest,
EventSource, WebSocket, navigator.sendBeacon. Reaching for one fails here
and forces the same deliberate decision a new fetch does.

A named list is a blocklist, and a blocklist is never complete. Known to
go through, and verified to: a name built at runtime and reached by
computed property access (`window["Event" + "Sour" + "ce"]`), anything
constructed through `eval` or `new Function`, any transport the platform
grows after this was written, and any alias spelled in a way none of the
shapes above happens to match. Those limits are real and stated rather than
papered over, because the next person maintaining this file will trust
what it says about itself — an earlier version of this paragraph claimed a
closure it did not have, and four live pollers made of these very tokens
went through while it said so.

EventSource is the one worth naming twice. A server-sent-events stream is
a permanent keepalive and carries no per-request header at all, so it
cannot be marked background under any policy — it would hold a tenant's
container awake for as long as the tab is open.

The names are matched in the raw source, comments included. A comment that
merely mentions one of them fails too; that is the cheap half of the
trade, and the fix is to reword the comment.

Checks:
  1. every `fetch(`/`postJSON(` call in js/ — whitespace before the paren
     allowed — sits in a declared function, classified as background-aware
     (its request is conditioned on its own `background` parameter) or
     user-action (it must never carry the header). Anything undeclared
     fails.
  2. each background-aware function's own call attaches BG conditionally,
     and no user-action call site references the header at all — a click, a
     send or a tab's first open is real engagement and must count.
  3. every `setInterval(`/`setTimeout(` occurrence in js/ is a declared
     site, and a declared callback that reaches a network function passes
     literal `true`. setTimeout is in the walk because a function that
     reschedules itself is a poller containing no `setInterval` at all.
  3b. no other transport appears by name, and neither network function is
     taken as a value, re-bound, reached through the global object, renamed
     in an object pattern, or called through optional chaining — see the
     limits stated above.
  4. hiding the tab stops the timer-driven polls, and showing it again calls
     refresh(true) — not a plain refresh(), which would count as a user
     action and could wake a stopped container just by switching tabs.
  5. the pause/resume state machine: every write to `paused` — plain
     assignment only, so a compound assignment, `++`/`--` and a
     destructuring write are each refused as a form — and every
     startTimers()/stopTimers() call in js/ is a declared site, and the one
     action the paused status line names, sending a message, actually
     resumes. See the second half of this file.

# `paused` was cleared only inside refresh(), sendChat() never called it, so

# to wake it.") got their reply on a page that stayed frozen on pre-pause
# data for the life of the page, under a banner still saying "paused".

# resume could go wrong, but by walking the closed set of literal tokens that
# can touch this state — every `paused =` assignment, every startTimers() and
# stopTimers() call — and DENYING any site not on a whitelist. A new route
# out of the paused state has to be declared here, which is the moment
# someone asks whether it actually resumes.

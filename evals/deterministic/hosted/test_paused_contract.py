"""The gateway's paused reply and the page that reads it -- acceptance 9.

The gateway sends a JSON body; main.js tests one field of it. Two string
literals in two languages in two directories, and nothing but this file holds
them together. A3 shipped the reader; B2 shipped the writer.

BOTH SIDES ARE ENUMERATED FROM SOURCE. An earlier draft enumerated the page
and hand-wrote the gateway as `{policy.PAUSED_CODE}`, which meant a second
code added in group D or E -- a `maintenance` or an `at_capacity` body, both
of which the spec already defines as states -- would sit there with no page
branch reading it and the test would stay green. The gateway side is now
`policy.CODES`, which is the set every hosted error body is built from.

AND THE PAGE SIDE IS CLOSED AGAINST SPELLING. It does not look for a
comparison shape; it counts every occurrence of the `.code` token in the
dashboard's JavaScript and requires the comparison scanner to have accounted
for all of them. A `switch (body.code)`, an `includes(body.code)`, a
comparison against a template literal or against a named constant leaves a
token the scanner did not claim, and the test fails asking for the scanner to
be extended rather than passing while a branch goes unread. That is the A5
inversion: the closed set is the token, and the recognised forms are checked
against it. `body.code == "paused"` with two equals signs is NOT one of those:
CODE_COMPARISON is `===?` and reads it deliberately, as the comment on it says.
An earlier draft of this paragraph claimed otherwise, which overstated the
guard by one form.

    so. So the two selectors are a union, and neither is load-bearing alone.

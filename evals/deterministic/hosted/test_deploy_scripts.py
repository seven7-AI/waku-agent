"""Every deploy script parses, the set of them is pinned, and compose.yaml
renders into the spec's table.

NOT A SOURCE SCAN. `bash -n` RUNS bash's parser over the file; a syntax error
in an operator script otherwise surfaces at 03:17 in a timer unit. The pinned
name set is the other half: a script added without a test here is a script
nobody parsed, and a script deleted is a script some other script still
sources.

NOT A YAML READ EITHER. `docker compose config` resolves the file the way the
daemon will read it -- variable substitution, env_file attachment, the short
volume syntax expanded -- so what this asserts is the rendered truth and not
the text. It needs the Compose CLI and NO DAEMON, which is why it is in this
tier and not in evals/hosted_docker/: the `validate` job's runner has the CLI,
and `validate` is the required check. A machine without the CLI skips with the
reason named, the same way evals/hosted_docker/conftest.py handles a missing
daemon.

"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL -- the container template's every isolation field.

A DRIFT CHECK, not the guard. It reads the dict template.py builds. The guard
that the kernel honoured any of it is evals/hosted_docker/test_isolation.py,
which reads `docker inspect` on a RUNNING container and then tries the thing
each field is supposed to prevent.

Both exist because they catch different things at different times. This one
runs on every PR, offline, and catches a dropped CapDrop the moment it is
dropped. That one runs where there is a daemon, and catches a CapDrop that is

    The GUARD is test_isolation.py::test_changing_the_project_id_of_ones_own_file_fails,
    which runs the two ioctls one value apart inside a real container and has a
    seccomp=unconfined control beside it. This is the offline half: it reads
    the committed profile and asserts the shape make_seccomp.py produces.

    WHY THE SHAPE MATTERS RATHER THAN THE COUNT. The profile's defaultAction is
    SCMP_ACT_ERRNO, so its rules are ALLOWANCES: an added deny for ioctl would
    lose to the unconditional allow it was meant to override. So `ioctl` must
    appear exactly once, in an allow carrying the condition -- not twice, and
    not once unconditionally with a deny somewhere below it.

    IT ASSERTS THE STATED GUARD AND NOT A STRONGER ONE. SCMP_CMP_NE compares
    the full 64-bit register while the kernel reads ioctl's request as a 32-bit
    unsigned int, so an aliased 0x1_401c5820 passes the filter and truncates
    back. seccomp has no masked-not-equal; the residual is named in
    make_seccomp.py's docstring and on G4's checklist, and this test does not
    pretend it is closed.

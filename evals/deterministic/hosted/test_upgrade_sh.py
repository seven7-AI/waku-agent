"""upgrade.sh's refusals, its order, and the arguments that drive it.

WHAT CAN GO WRONG HERE IS ORDER, not shell. An upgrade that restarts the
services before rebuilding the images restarts them onto the old ones; an
upgrade that runs restart-all before the gateway answers again restarts every
tenant through a gateway that is not there. Both look like success.

Also covered, added on review: the four guards that had no fixture at all
(waku_require_root, the readiness waku_die, -h|--help, and --ref itself --
both that it is honoured and that the default is origin/main), the dirty
guard reading git's own exit status rather than only its output, and a
regression test for the lib.sh finding this task exists to surface --
waku_load_install_env used to validate only the four names install.sh itself
needs, so a fifth name upgrade.sh dereferences died on bash's own `set -u`
message well after the images were rebuilt and the services restarted.

    This script used to run `waku_compose up -d` bare, with a comment claiming
    that a service scaled to 0 stays at 0 without the flag. It does not:
    --scale is a flag on one invocation, not state compose keeps, and
    compose.yaml declares no replicas for proxy, so the default is one.

    Observed on agent.waku.one on 2026-09-28, the first time this script ran
    against a real deployment: the proxy started and then restart-looped on
    `No module named hosted.proxy.__main__` forever, because the service
    carries `restart: unless-stopped`.

    The assertion is on the `up -d` call specifically. A `--scale` appearing
    anywhere in the call log would also be satisfied by the build step or a
    later command, which is how this class of test passes while the flag is on
    the wrong line.

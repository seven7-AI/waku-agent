"""The sign-in page: its assets, its one Supabase call, and the design system.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. On 2026-09-27 the page stopped loading a 218 KB
Supabase bundle to make one request, and started using the Waku design
system. Both changes moved something out of a library's hands and into this
repo's, and each created a way to be silently wrong that nothing else checks:

  the copies drift      design/ and fonts/ here are copies of waku/ops/static/,
                        because the services image's build context refuses
                        waku/ outright. A copy nobody compares is a fork.
  an asset is orphaned  the page references a file by URL; the gateway serves
                        an ALLOWLIST. Add a <link> and forget the entry and
                        the page loads unstyled, with a 404 nobody reads.
  the request drifts    login.js now writes the /auth/v1/otp call by hand. The
                        shape is what 2.117.1 sent; nothing but this file says
                        so, and the failure is invisible until a real sign-in.

The third is the reason the first two are written as they are. Each derives
its fixture list FROM the page rather than from a list kept beside it: a
hand-kept list of assets is a list of the assets somebody remembered.

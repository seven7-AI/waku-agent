"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL -- a restored tenant comes back with their disk quota.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (C2-1). `_restore` removes the tenant's two
directories and then calls `provision()`, whose CREATE path is the only thing
that ever issues `xfs_quota project -s`. An earlier shape removed them in two
separate container runs, and `template.task_container` binds BOTH tenant paths
unconditionally -- so the second run's create re-made the first run's
directory. The Docker daemon creates a missing bind source as a root-owned
directory, so `home` was back before `provision()` looked, `mkdir` raised
FileExistsError, and `home` took the `set_limit` branch: XFS project 0,
uncounted and unlimited, for the rest of that tenant's life. `env` was fine.
The asymmetry was invisible, and a tenant who got a restore could then fill the
shared data disk and stop every other tenant on the VM.

THE FAKE DAEMON BELOW CREATES MISSING BIND SOURCES, which is the whole point:
without that behaviour modelled, this file passes against the broken sequence.
It is the documented behaviour of the legacy `Binds` form and the reason
`--mount` exists.

This is an OFFLINE guard, not a drift check. The Docker half is
evals/hosted_docker/test_isolation.py::test_a_restored_tenant_keeps_their_own_project_id,
which reads the real XFS project id off `home` after a real restore.

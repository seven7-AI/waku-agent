"""Only verified, non-anonymous, active users get in -- acceptance 13.

A LOCALLY SIGNED JWKS. Nothing here touches the network: the fixture generates
a P-256 key, publishes it as a JWKS document in the shape the live project's
own document has, and hands the verifier a fetch function that returns it. The
live document was read once, on 2026-09-24, and its shape is what
gatewaylib.signing_key reproduces; a test that fetched it would be a test that
fails on a train.

THE FIRST TESTS IN THIS FILE ARE THE SPEC FINDING. spec.md says the verifier
checks `aud` is "authenticated". A real token from this project carries
aud=https://api.waku.one/mcp and role=authenticated, so a verifier written to
that sentence refuses every real sign-in. They are here so that nobody
"fixes" the audience back to the spec's word without a red test saying what
it costs.

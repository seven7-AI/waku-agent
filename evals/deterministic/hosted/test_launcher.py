"""The launcher: who gets a token, who gets a container, and who does not.

A FAKE SPAWNER, NOT A FAKE LAUNCHER. Every test here drives the real
Launcher against a recording spawner and a real ControlDb on a temp file, and
then reads what the spawner was asked for. Nothing asserts that a method was
called; the assertions are on the requests that reached the wire-facing
object, which is the only thing the real spawner would ever see.

asyncio.run around each coroutine: the repo has no pytest-asyncio and two

"""The admin path and the running gateway agree -- acceptance 23.

The restart-all half is E3's, because "the gateway forwards to the new
address" needs a forwarder that reads an address, and it is the one test here
that takes `wired` rather than `harness`.

EVERY TEST HERE THAT MATTERS GOES OVER THE SOCKET. admin.handle is reachable
in-process, and test_auth.py calls it that way once for brevity, but the ones
here -- the allowlist and the disable -- write a JSON line to a real Unix

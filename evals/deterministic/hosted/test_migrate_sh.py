"""migrate.sh: the order the old VM shuts down in, and what each half refuses.

THE ORDER IS THE TEST ON THE --out SIDE. Every step is irreversible in the
sense that matters to an operator -- once the final backup has been taken, a
turn a tenant writes afterwards is on a machine nobody is going to start again
-- so the front door closes first, the fleet second, and the backup third.

THE SIBLING SCRIPTS ARE REPLACED, NOT STUBBED ON PATH. migrate.sh calls
"$here/backup.sh" and "$here/restore.sh" by path, so the whole deploy directory
is copied into tmp_path and those two files are replaced with recorders. lib.sh
beside them is the real one: waku_compose, waku_admin and waku_load_install_env
are what this script's order is made of.

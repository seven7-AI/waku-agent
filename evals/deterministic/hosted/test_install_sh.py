"""checks.sh's six functions and install.sh's refusals, offline.

WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT DO: it never creates a directory owned by UID 10002,
never starts a container and never asks a daemon anything. The install's
effects are evals/hosted_docker/test_compose.py's, and the whole install on a
real VM is recorded check F1-R1. What is HERE is every decision install.sh
makes before it touches the machine -- which is where an installer goes wrong
quietly.

WHERE THE LINE FALLS, AND WHY IT FALLS THERE. install.sh parses its flags,
checks that every required one was given and checks the domain's shape, and
only then calls waku_require_root and reads /etc/os-release. Everything above
that line is reachable from a maintainer's laptop and is tested here.
Everything below it -- the XFS refusal, the two Supabase refusals, the
firewall unit's two paths, the proxy's scale rule -- needs root, /proc and an
Ubuntu release, so it belongs to recorded check F1-R1 and is written up there
with a result block. Moving waku_require_root above the parser to "fix" that
would make a script that demands root before telling you a flag is misspelt,
which is a worse script; faking it away behind an environment variable would
put a hole in the one guard that keeps this installer from half-running as a
normal user.

"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the dashboard's public surface, pinned.

This is a characterization net, not a feature test. It exists so that moving or
deleting code inside dashboard.py cannot silently remove a URL the browser calls
or a key the page reads. Written BEFORE the dead-code deletion and the 1,695 ->
~880 line split, and it stayed green through both without a single edit to the
route lists — which is the whole point: the browser's contract never moved, only
the code behind it.

The handler list below is checked with getattr(dashboard, ...), so it also pins
the re-exports. After the split, most handlers LIVE in arena / catalog /
settings_api / browser_agent and are imported here. If one stops being reachable
from `dashboard`, the router breaks and this fails.

If you add a route or a payload key on purpose, update the list below in the
same commit — that edit is the review signal that the public surface changed.

    CONTROLLER RULING (A5 review round 3): what makes a dict a routing table
    is what the code DOES with it, not what it is called. Round 3 trusted any
    name bound to a dict literal, but only validated and pinned the keys of
    the one literally named `routes`, so `if self.path in STATIC_TYPES:` — or
    in any new `_ADMIN_ROUTES = {...}` a contributor adds by analogy with the
    `routes` dict a few hundred lines away — dispatched live with every test
    green. Deciding by the use site closes that without hardcoding a name:

      - `STATIC_TYPES` is an extension -> MIME lookup. It is read once, as
        `STATIC_TYPES.get(target.suffix, ...)`, INSIDE an already-pinned
        route's handler. self.path never meets it, so it is not a dispatch
        surface and nothing here touches it — no false positive on a
        legitimate content-type table.
      - Write `if self.path in STATIC_TYPES:` tomorrow and that same table
        becomes a dispatch surface by that act alone: its keys are collected
        as routes and have to be pinned, which is exactly the loud failure
        that case deserves.

    CONTROLLER RULING (A5 review round 4): forbid the mutation, do not try to
    track it. A dispatch dict filled in after its definition —
    `N["/api/x"] = h`, or `N.update({...})` — cannot be read statically in
    general, and round 4's partial answer was worse than a miss: the
    `.update()` case FAILED naming only the literal key, so pinning that key
    turned the whole suite green while the added route stayed live and
    unpinned. A tripwire may fail safe; it may never fail open, and it may
    certainly never pay for a wrong fix with a green suite.

    So the key set of a dispatch dict has to be one dict literal, bound once,
    never touched again. This is recognised default-deny, the same way rounds
    3 and 4 recognise everything else: ANY attribute on the name that is not
    on the short read-only whitelist above is refused, rather than a list of

    it. That refuses a few harmless reads too — `.copy()` is the obvious one —

    dict grows a method. Item assignment, `del`, and augmented assignment are

    review round 2): rounds 1 and 2 both enumerated COMPARISON FORMS
    (`self.path == ...`, then also `in`/`startswith`/wrapped-expressions) —
    an open set. Each round closed what the last review found and the next
    reviewer found six more (reversed `==`, an f-string, an `IfExp`, a
    walrus, `urlparse(self.path)`, `re.match`, a `match` statement). Adding
    shape #7 would just invite #8.

    So this walks the closed set instead: every OCCURRENCE of `self.path` —
    it is one specific attribute access, and ast.walk finds all of them,
    full stop. For each occurrence, this asks only "is this sitting in one
    of a few whitelisted, literal-only positions", and fails if not. How the
    surrounding expression is written no longer matters: an f-string, an
    IfExp, a walrus, or any other wrapper simply never lands self.path in a
    whitelisted position, so it fails automatically without this guard
    having to have been written with that shape in mind.

    Whitelisted positions for a self.path occurrence (all require the OTHER
    side to be a string literal, or a literal tuple/list/set of them):
      - either side of `self.path == "..."` or `self.path != "..."`
      - either side of `self.path in (...)` / `self.path not in (...)` — or
        the container is a dispatch dict, whose keys are then validated and
        collected as routes by `_dispatch_dict_facts`, whatever it is named
      - the receiver of `self.path.startswith(...)`
      - the index of `NAME[self.path]` (a lookup into a dispatch dict, whose
        keys are validated and pinned the same way)
      - the argument to `urlparse(self.path).query` — reading the QUERY
        STRING is not a route match the way reading `.path` back out would
        be, and today's code only ever reads `.query`; `urlparse(self.path)
        .path == "..."` (one of the six shapes this round closes) is a
        DIFFERENT position — the parent is `.path`, not `.query` — so it is
        deliberately NOT covered by this one and still fails
      - the argument to `self._serve_static(self.path)` — a call to the
        handler's own method, not a hand-off outside the class (that is
        `_self_passed_to_helper`'s job), already reached only after
        `self.path.startswith("/static/")` passed

    Every other occurrence is a violation: an f-string, an `IfExp`, a
    walrus, an argument to any other call (`re.match(pattern, self.path)`),
    a subscript, a `match` subject, an unrecognised comparison operator —
    anything at all. There is deliberately no "match statement with literal
    cases" carve-out: dashboard.py does not use one today, and adding that
    exception would be exactly the kind of shape-chasing this rewrite exists

"""The files a tenant's container finds on its first start.

Rendered inside a throwaway container as UID 10001, with only that tenant's
two directories mounted, because a tenant can plant symlinks in them and no
host process with more privilege than 10001 may open a path in there.

It only creates what is MISSING, and that is the whole of the contract: a
directory a tenant deleted, an .env or a SOUL.md that is not there, and a
loosened mode on .env. Provisioning runs again before every start, so each of
those is repaired on the next one. What is NOT repaired is the content of a
file that exists -- a half-written .env from a provision that died mid-write
stays half-written, and a SOUL.md the tenant edited stays edited, because
there is no way to tell those two apart from here.

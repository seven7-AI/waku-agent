"""Route policy, path hygiene and payload filters -- design section 8.

Pure logic. The gateway's outermost layer calls these and does the I/O.

WHAT MAKES THIS TABLE TRUSTWORTHY. Design section 8 says a route with no entry
passes, and that is right: isolation comes from the container, not from here,
so a new upstream route can at worst spend its own tenant's quota. What would
NOT be right is nobody noticing that a route arrived. So the table is closed
against waku's own pinned route list: evals/deterministic/hosted/
test_route_contract.py asserts that the keys here are exactly the routes
evals/deterministic/test_dashboard_routes.py pins, plus two prefixes that are
not routes of their own ("/" and "/api/compare").  Add a route to the dashboard
and that test names it until somebody classifies it.

Exactly two entries are NOT routes the dashboard serves, and the route
contract's ALLOWED_EXTRA_ENTRIES names the same two:
  "/"              the catch-all. It is what makes design section 8's "a path
                   with no entry passes" a line of this table rather than an
                   unwritten default, and decide() relies on it matching
                   everything that survives path hygiene
  "/api/compare"   a prefix, so a compare route added upstream is blocked
                   rather than passed
"/api/memory-arena" is a prefix too, and it is longer than "/api/memory" so it
wins -- but it is also a live GET route the dashboard serves and A5 pins, so it
is not one of the extras. "/api/compare/history" is longer than "/api/compare"
and passes, which is the one compare route the hosted dashboard needs.

# page in the same PR, or do neither.
#
# A HOSTED ERROR BODY IS A DICT CARRYING A `code` KEY, and test_paused_contract.py
# finds them structurally: every dict this module declares, and every dict one
# level inside one, is checked for that key, and their codes must be exactly
# this set. There is no name you can give a body that hides it -- that is the
# point, and it is why the rule is the code's and not this comment's.
#
# Name one `*_BODY` anyway. It is good practice, and the test reads the name
# too, for the one thing structure cannot give: a dict named like a body but
# carrying no `code` can only fall through the page's branch, and the name is
# what lets the test say so.
#
# This started as a list of bodies written out by hand in the test, then as a
# scan by name. Review defeated both: an AT_CAPACITY_BODY with no entry here,

# left every test in that file green with a live code the page never reads.

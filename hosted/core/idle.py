"""What to do with a request, given what the fleet is doing -- the spec's
"the gateway, per request" flowchart, minus the HTTP.

Pure logic on an injected clock. Group E wraps this; group C makes the starts
and stops real.

WHO REFRESHES THE IDLE CLOCK, AND WHY IT IS NOT set_status(). There are three
ways a container comes to be RUNNING, and they are not the same event:

  a real request       admit() returns "start" or "evict_then_start", and the
                       request that caused it IS activity -- admit() touches
                       on both branches. Missing this is not cosmetic: the
                       container is started with a last_activity from before
                       the idle stop, so the next sweep, within sixty seconds,
                       stops the container the tenant just waited for.
  a gateway restart    adopt(), for a container the spawner's `list` reports.
                       The spec: "treats each as active from that moment, so
                       the idle timer starts fresh and no container is
                       orphaned." It refreshes ONLY when the fleet has no
                       clock for that tenant, because adopt() is also called
                       on a re-list mid-life (a container that refused a
                       connection), and resetting the clock there would keep a
                       broken container alive forever.
  anything else        touch() first. E2 starts a container on first login,
                       before any request reaches admit(); a login is a user
                       action, so E2 calls touch() and then set_status().

set_status() itself records a transition and nothing more. It used to refresh
the clock "if last_activity == 0.0", which is true exactly once in a
container's life, so every restart after the first was stopped a minute later.

        THIS METHOD TAKES THE SLOT IT GRANTS. It used to only answer, and the
        caller then suspended -- on a unix socket to the spawner, and on the
        `stop` of an evicted container before that -- while the fleet still
        said a slot was free. Measured at max_running=1: two interleaved
        POST /auth/session produced two containers, and so did two interleaved
        requests for different tenants through the real forwarder. The cap is
        derived from the VM's memory, so exceeding it is the kernel
        OOM-killing a stranger's container mid-turn; a cap that a second
        caller can walk through is not a cap.

        So both start arms mark the tenant STARTING, which running() already
        counts. After this call the arithmetic is settled and nothing a caller
        does while suspended can change it.

        The evict arm ALSO marks the evicted tenant STOPPED, and that half is
        belt and braces rather than load-bearing today -- said here because it
        was measured, not guessed. Launcher.stop calls _forget_running
        (status STOPPED) before its first await, so through the gateway the
        victim is already out of running() by the time any second caller can
        be scheduled: deleting this line leaves both interleaved gateway tests
        green. It is kept because admit's answer should be self-consistent on
        its own -- a caller that admitted and then yielded before stopping,
        or a future stop() that awaited the spawner first, would otherwise
        find the same victim RUNNING and evict it twice. That property is
        pinned at this level instead, by
        test_admit_settles_the_cap_without_any_help_from_the_caller.

        WHO GIVES THE SLOT BACK. Every path out of Launcher.start either
        reaches a container (RUNNING) or calls _forget_running/release_start
        (STOPPED). A reservation that leaked would not over-commit the VM --
        it would shrink it by one container for the life of the process --
        but it would be just as wrong, so it is closed rather than argued
        about.

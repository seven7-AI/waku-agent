# One idempotent install of hosted waku on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM.
#
# IDEMPOTENT MEANS TWO THINGS HERE, and the spec names both: a rerun skips
# finished steps, and it NEVER OVERWRITES EXISTING CONFIG. So every config file
# is written only when it is absent, and a rerun with different flags says which
# file it kept rather than quietly changing a value the running services were
# started with. To change one, edit the file and restart that service; F4's
# README says so.
#
# Written to parse under bash 3.2, like hosted/image/build.sh. It RUNS on
# Ubuntu 24.04's bash 5.2.

  <domain>                    the apex, for example agent.waku.one. Tenants get
                              <id>.<domain>, so a wildcard record must exist.
                              Lowercase, at least two labels, no scheme and no
                              wildcard: the wildcard is this script's to write.
  --dns-provider              a caddy-dns module name, for example route53. A
                              module whose Caddy directive takes an inline
                              argument names it here too, for example
                              'cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}'; the
                              first word is the module xcaddy builds
  --dns-module-version        pin that module, for example @v1.6.2. Default:
                              whatever xcaddy resolves on the day it builds
  --dns-env-file PATH         a file of NAME=VALUE lines: the DNS provider's
                              CREDENTIALS. Delete it once this has run
  --dns-env NAME=VALUE        one NON-SECRET variable for that module, such as
                              AWS_REGION; repeatable. A secret given this way
                              stays in root's shell history and in `ps` output
                              for the whole install, which this script cannot
                              clean up: put secrets in --dns-env-file
  --data-device               the data disk's block device. xfs_quota needs it
                              inside the spawner's container
  --free-model                OPTIONAL, and needs --platform-key-file. Without
                              both, this install offers no free tier and every
                              tenant brings their own key -- which is what a
                              deployment without the metering proxy (group D)
                              actually does. The one model the free tier
                              allows. Written into
                              BOTH spawner.env and proxy.env
  --platform-key-file         a file holding the platform's model key, and
                              nothing else. Delete it once this has run
  --max-running               a whole number of at least 1. No upper limit:
                              oversubscribing is the operator's decision.
                              Default: (memory - 2 GB) / 150 MB
  --tenant-disk               a size of at least 1 byte, optionally K, M or G.
                              Default: 1G. NOT 0: XFS reads bhard=0 as no limit
  --restic-repository         restic's repository, for example
                              s3:s3.amazonaws.com/waku-backups. The object
                              store's own credentials are added to
                              config/backup.env by hand afterwards; see
                              backup.env.example
  --restic-password-file      a file holding restic's repository password, and
                              nothing else. It is NOT copied: config/backup.env
                              names it and restic reads it at 03:17, so keep it
                              on the VM at mode 0600 and back it up somewhere
                              else -- a repository whose password is lost is a
                              repository nobody can read
  --dns-allow                 default: the resolvers in
                              /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
USAGE
}

# The flags that take a value, given without one, used to die on bash's own
# `$2: unbound variable` -- a refusal that ran nothing, but the one message in
# this file that did not read like the others. waku_needs_value (lib.sh) now
# owns the count check; the closed set of flag names and the message stay
# here, because the message and the usage text are this script's own.

# A file that must be a credential file and not a binary one.
#
# It cannot be folded into any character set that looks at the VALUE, because
# command substitution DROPS NUL bytes: a file holding `abc\0def` is read as
# `abc`, which every later check happily accepts, and the operator gets a
# credential that looks written and is wrong -- failing at ACME hours later
# with no clue why. A closed set cannot refuse a character that no longer
# exists by the time it looks, so the file is measured in bytes before it is
# read. `tr -d` and `wc -c` are in coreutils on Ubuntu and in the base system
# on macOS, so this runs wherever the tests do.
#
# BOTH credential files go through it. An earlier version had it on
# --platform-key-file only, and two guards on the same class of input that
# disagree are worse than one, because the operator learns the wrong rule.
# LC_ALL=C like every other guard in this file that inspects bytes. `tr`
# reading a byte sequence that is not valid in the ambient locale is the
# failure this pins out: measured on macOS, `tr -d '\000'` over a file holding
# a high byte returns "Illegal byte sequence" under a UTF-8 locale and the two
# counts then disagree for a reason that has nothing to do with NUL. GNU `tr`
# is byte-oriented and would be fine; the pin means both behave the same, and
# it costs a subshell.

# --free-model and --platform-key-file were required until 2026-09-27, so

# had one. None of them did: the metering proxy is group D, it is not built,
# and the proxy service runs at zero replicas. Every tenant container came up
# pointed at an address nothing listens on, stock waku read the variables and
# showed "Hosted free tier: enabled, current" on its Models page, and the
# tenant's first message returned APIConnectionError.
#
# So --free-model is now the signal: give it and this install has a free tier,
# leave it out and tenants bring their own key, which is the ordinary provider
# switch on the Models page. The pairing is checked because half a free tier
# is the same lie in a smaller size -- a key with no model reaches a proxy
# that cannot be told what to run, and a model with no key cannot authenticate
# to it. hosted/spawner/template.config_from_env refuses the matching half-set
# in config/spawner.env, so neither end of this can be configured alone.

# --- refusals, before anything is created ---------------------------------

# FIRST OF THIS SECTION, AND DELIBERATELY AHEAD OF THE UBUNTU CHECK BELOW.
# MEASURED ON THE LIVE VM, where Caddy ran as a systemd unit holding both
# ports (the holding page): without this, install.sh would run the apt
# install, build both images, write four env files and create both bridges,
# and only THEN fail at `compose up` -- leaving a half-installed host with a
# foreign Caddy still serving. Nothing above this line is irreversible; the
# apt-get below is the first thing that is, so the check has to run before it
# -- and it does not need to know this is Ubuntu to know two ports are
# contested, so it does not wait on the check that does. Ordering it first
# also keeps it reachable the way every check above waku_require_root is:
# offline, with `ss` and `docker` stubbed on PATH and `id` stubbed to answer
# root -- evals/deterministic/hosted/test_install_sh.py does exactly that,
# without needing a /etc/os-release or a /proc this machine may not have.
#
# "free, or held by OUR OWN Caddy container" -- not "free" -- because a rerun
# is idempotent (spec: "a rerun skips finished steps and never overwrites
# existing config") and on a rerun this deployment's own Caddy correctly holds
# both ports. waku_ports_free_or_ours decides that from Docker's compose
# labels, never from Caddy's process name, which a hand-built binary shares.

# supports. restic, sqlite3 and zstd are for backup and restore; jq and curl
# are for the two Supabase checks below.
#
# ONE PROBE PER PACKAGE, AND ONLY WHAT IS MISSING IS INSTALLED. The earlier
# shape probed jq, curl and docker and then installed all seven or none: on a
# host that already had those three -- which is the ordinary shape of a machine
# somebody has been running something on, and exactly the shape of the VM this
# is being installed on, which carries Docker CE and a hand-built Caddy --
# restic, sqlite3 and zstd were never installed and the run exited 0. restic is
# then first reached at 03:17 inside the timer, and host sqlite3 is what
# backup.sh and restore.sh run to copy and integrity-check both platform
# databases. Nothing in this repository probed either.
#
# INSTALLING ONLY THE MISSING ONES ALSO STOPS THIS BREAKING A WORKING HOST. A
# machine running Docker CE has `docker` and the compose plugin already, and
# `apt-get install docker.io` on it is a package conflict over the daemon this
# deployment needs -- so a missing restic must not drag docker.io in behind it.
#
# THE COMPOSE AND BUILDX PLUGINS ARE NOT BINARIES ON PATH, so each is probed by
# asking docker for it rather than with `command -v`. A host with Docker CE has
# both plugins from Docker's own packages and needs neither from Ubuntu's.
# BuildKit -- and so buildx, the only thing that provides it here -- is not an
# optimisation: hosted/image/build.sh sets DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 because the
# per-Dockerfile ignore files that keep this build context free of secrets are
# a BuildKit feature, unread by the legacy builder.
# waku_missing_packages and waku_require_commands are checks.sh's, so that a
# deterministic test can call them with a PATH holding some of the tools and

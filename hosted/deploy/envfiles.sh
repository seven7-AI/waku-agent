# The body of each config/*.env file install.sh writes. Sourced, never run.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FILE OF ITS OWN. The brief's comment on the gateway block says
# it: "a name missing here raises at startup; a name MISSPELT here sets nothing
# and raises nothing". hosted/deploy/gateway.env.example and
# spawner.env.example are pinned against their modules in BOTH directions by
# test_gateway.py and test_container_template.py -- and install.sh, the thing
# that writes the file the services actually read, was pinned against neither,
# because its heredocs sat inside a script no test can run without root, an
# Ubuntu release and a Docker daemon.
#
# Moving the three bodies into functions makes them reachable:
# evals/deterministic/hosted/test_deploy_scripts.py sources this file, calls
# each one, and compares the names it emitted with
# gateway.config.REQUIRED_ENV_NAMES and spawner.template.ENV_NAMES in both
# directions. A misspelling is now a red test rather than a service that starts
# and quietly ignores a setting the operator believes they made.
#
# EACH FUNCTION READS NAMED GLOBALS, listed above it, and prints to stdout.
# Positional parameters were the alternative and they are worse here: seven
# unlabelled arguments at the call site is how the wrong one ends up third.
# `set -u` in the caller means a global nobody set is an error and not an empty
# line, which is the property that matters.

# Read by every other script in hosted/deploy/ through waku_load_install_env,
# and by `docker compose --env-file`, which is what makes ${WAKU_ROOT} and the
# image tags resolve inside compose.yaml.
#
# EVERY VALUE IS SINGLE-QUOTED, and this is the one function in the repository
# where that is not a style choice. This file has TWO parsers with two
# grammars: bash's `.`, in waku_load_install_env, and Compose's `--env-file`.
# Written unquoted, the documented Cloudflare value --
# `WAKU_DNS_PROVIDER=cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}` -- is read by
# Compose correctly and by bash as the assignment `WAKU_DNS_PROVIDER=cloudflare`
# followed by the COMMAND `{env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}`. So every script that
# loads this file died with `{env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}: command not found` and
# an empty WAKU_DNS_PROVIDER, install.sh included -- at the line that loads it,
# which is after the apt install, the tree, both bridges, five config files and
# three image builds. A Cloudflare install could not complete.
#
# And the tail of such a line RUNS AS ROOT: `--dns-provider 'route53 $(...)'`
# passes both of the flag's checks (the module check reads only the first word,
# the whole-string check is [:print:]) and the substitution is performed by
# whichever of five root scripts sources the file next. F1's round 4 closed that
# door for a NEWLINE in this same value and left it open for a SPACE, in the one
# flag whose documented interface requires a space.
#
# Single quotes are the form BOTH grammars agree on, measured against Compose
# v2.34's own `--env-file` parser: it strips them and performs no substitution
# inside them. install.sh refuses a single quote in every value that reaches
# this function, so no value can end its own quoting.

# THE FOURTH FILE, AND THE ONLY ONE NO SERVICE READS. config/backup.env is
# root's: backup.sh and restore.sh source it through waku_load_backup_env and

# heredoc in install.sh for the same reason as the other four -- so a test can
# run the writer and the reader against each other instead of reading either.
#
# THE OBJECT STORE'S CREDENTIALS ARE NOT HERE. install.sh has no flag for
# them: the operator appends AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to
# this file by hand, backup.env.example shows the shape, and waku_write_config
# never overwrites, so a rerun keeps what they added.
# SINGLE-QUOTED FOR waku_install_env's REASON, and this is the SECOND of the
# two files bash sources. waku_load_backup_env does `set -a; . "$file"`, so a
# value holding `$(...)` is a substitution performed as root at 03:17 -- and
# --restic-repository's own check is refuse_unprintable, which refuses a space
# and permits every metacharacter. Found by asking the question the whole-branch
# review's meta-finding asks: which OTHER consumer reads a file this one writes?
#
# install.sh refuses a single quote in both values, so neither can end its own

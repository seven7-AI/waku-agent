# cannot change and each start carries a new proxy token, so every start creates
# a new container from the current image tag. An idle tenant is therefore
# upgraded the moment they come back, for free. --now is for the case where the
# upgrade fixes something a running tenant is suffering from, and it costs every

#
# It said: "the proxy stays at whatever replica count it has: `up -d` with no
# --scale leaves a service scaled to 0 at 0, so an upgrade does not quietly
# start a module that is not there." Compose does not work that way. `--scale`
# is a flag on one invocation, not state compose keeps: an `up -d` without it
# brings every declared service to its declared replica count, and compose.yaml
# declares none for proxy, so the default is one.
#
# Observed on agent.waku.one on 2026-09-28, the first time this script ran
# against a real deployment: `Container waku-proxy-1 Creating ... Started`,
# and then `No module named hosted.proxy.__main__` on a loop, forever, because
# the service carries `restart: unless-stopped`. An upgrade quietly started a
# module that is not there -- the exact thing the comment promised it would
# not do, asserted rather than tested.
#
# The condition is install.sh's, verbatim in meaning: whether the checkout has
# a proxy to run. When group D lands the file appears and the scale flag stops
# being added, on both paths, without either of them being edited.

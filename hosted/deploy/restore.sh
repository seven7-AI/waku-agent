# THE ORDER IS THE SPEC'S, and every line of it is load-bearing:
#
#   --all: stop every tenant container through the RUNNING gateway (their
#   tokens may be missing from the restored control.db), then stop the gateway
#   and the proxy, restore both databases as root with their owners and modes,
#   start both services, and only then restore every tenant one by one through
#   the admin command.
#
#   one tenant: restic into the tenant's staging slot, refuse without a
#   manifest, then ask the gateway -- which stops the tenant's container first
#   and holds them in maintenance while the spawner archives the old tree,
#   recreates the two directories empty WITH their project quota, and copies in.
#
# NOTHING HERE WALKS A TENANT'S TREE AS ROOT. restic writes the staging slot;
# the slot is emptied in a container as UID 10001; the spawner does the rest.
#
# NOTHING IS STOPPED UNTIL THE SNAPSHOT HAS BEEN PROVED TO EXIST. The spec's
# order is about the five DESTRUCTIVE stages, and fetching a snapshot into
# staging is not one of them: staging is a handoff area outside every live
# tree. So --all pulls the control snapshot and checks it FIRST, with the
# platform still serving. A repository that is empty, unreachable, or holding
# a control.db that fails PRAGMA integrity_check then costs a refusal and no
# downtime at all, instead of a fleet and two services stopped in front of a
# restore that cannot happen.

# THE SETS ARE lib.sh's, AND THE CHOICE OF WHICH ONES IS THIS SCRIPT'S.
# What restore.sh does with a tenant id is wider than what backup.sh does with
# one: it names the staging slot that waku_reset_staging_slot bind-mounts and
# runs `find /staging -mindepth 1 -delete` inside, the `--include` path restic
# writes, the `tenant:<id>` restic tag, and the argument the gateway acts on.
# Every one of those is a path or a selector, so `..` or a tag with a comma in
# it is not a bad id, it is a different target.
#
# THE OTHER HALF OF --tenant's SET IS AN EMAIL, which backup.sh does not take:
# `restore.sh --tenant mei@example.com` is in the operator guide. An email is
# never a path -- it is turned into a tenant id below and the id goes through
# waku_is_tenant_id before it reaches anything.
#
# --snapshot HAS ONE TOO, waku_is_snapshot_id, because the value is the
# positional argument of `restic restore` and restic's restore flags include
# `--target`, which is where the snapshot's contents land.
#
# All three moved into lib.sh in F4: this file and backup.sh each carried the
# same waku_is_tenant_id byte for byte, and tenant.sh and migrate.sh needed them
# too. Four copies of a closed set is four places for it to drift.

# where the sentence came from -- and FALSE of GNU coreutils, which is what
# Ubuntu 24.04 runs. GNU install is cp plus chown plus chmod: it unlinks the
# destination and reopens it O_CREAT|O_TRUNC. No temporary, no rename. So on
# the platform this actually runs on, a kill mid-copy left a TRUNCATED
# control.db, and with the log already removed there was nothing to recover
# it from -- worse than either of the two orders the -wal decision below
# compares. install still does the owner, the group and the mode in one call,
# which is why it is still here; rename(2) keeps all three.
#
# THE -wal AND -shm GO BEFORE THE RENAME. They belong to the OLD database and

# it, a run killed at any point leaves either the old database with its log
# (before the rm), the old database without its log -- older and internally
# consistent (between), or the new database (after the rename). No window
# leaves a torn file at the live path.
# THE TEMPORARY IS REMOVED BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN, which is the same `[ -L ]`
# reasoning every other named path in this script carries. GNU install opens
# the destination O_CREAT|O_TRUNC and so FOLLOWS a symlink sitting at that
# name: it would write the database through the link, and the `mv` below would
# then rename the LINK onto the live path. `rm -f` removes a link as a link.

# SOURCED, NEVER RUN. install.sh sources this file and so does
# evals/deterministic/hosted/test_install_sh.py, which is the whole reason the
# first six functions take a path instead of reading /proc/meminfo themselves:
# a function that reads a fixed path can only be tested on a machine that has
# it, and macOS has no /proc at all.
#
# EVERY ONE OF THEM IS DEFAULT-DENY. A JWKS document with no `keys` array, a
# settings document with no `disable_signup` field, a /proc/mounts line for a
# different mount point: all of them exit non-zero. An installer that treats
# "I could not tell" as "yes" is how a VM ends up serving with open signup.
#
# THE SEVENTH, waku_ports_free_or_ours, CANNOT TAKE A PATH, and that is a
# deliberate break from the other six, not an oversight. What it decides --
# whether :80 and :443 are free, or held by THIS deployment's own Caddy
# container rather than something else -- is not in any file: it is live
# process and container state, read through `ss` and `docker` on PATH. Tests
# reach it the way test_install_sh.py already reaches docker, curl and
# apt-get: stub executables placed first on PATH. It is still default-deny --
# no listener passes, our own container's compose labels pass, and everything
# else, including "the tool to check is missing", is a refusal.

# :80 and :443, as A CLOSED SET WITH DEFAULT-DENY: no listener -> pass; our own
# compose project's caddy container -> pass; anything else, including "the
# tool needed to tell is missing" -> refuse.
#
# WHY NOT "THE PORT IS FREE": that breaks idempotence, which is F1's own
# recorded check -- a rerun changes nothing. On a rerun THIS DEPLOYMENT'S OWN
# Caddy container correctly holds both ports, so a naive free-port guard would
# refuse the install it is meant to protect on every run after the first.
#
# WHY NOT A PROCESS NAME: a hand-built `caddy` binary and this deployment's
# container both answer to `caddy` in `ps`, so a name match would pass on a
# VM that already has one holding the ports -- which is exactly the collision
# this exists to catch. "Ours" comes from Docker instead: the compose PROJECT
# and SERVICE labels Compose stamps on every container it starts
# (com.docker.compose.project, com.docker.compose.service; compose.yaml names
# this deployment's project "waku" and its Caddy service "caddy"). Caddy runs
# with `network_mode: host` (compose.yaml), so its process is not hidden
# behind a container network namespace -- the pid `ss` reports on the host IS
# the container's own process, with no indirection to undo.
#
# THE PORT-LISTING TOOL IS `ss`, iproute2's, the one Ubuntu 24.04 ships by
# default (iproute2 is Priority: important on every Ubuntu server image) --
# not `lsof` (its own package, not installed by default) and not `netstat`
# (net-tools, also not installed by default on 24.04). Either would be a new
# default dependency for a script AGENTS.md hard rule 3 forbids one in.
# `ss -H -tlnp`: TCP, listening, numeric, with the process that owns each
# socket -- `-H` drops the header line, and the state column is still checked
# below rather than trusted, in case a given `ss` build does not honour it.
# ABSENT IS A REFUSAL, NOT A PASS. `command -v ss` failing, or `ss` itself
# failing, exits this function non-zero with a message that says so -- the
# same "I could not tell" default-deny as every check above it.
#
# STDOUT ON A REFUSAL ONLY: one line per foreign listener, naming the port,
# the pid, the process, and the container when it is one and is not ours --
# so install.sh's refusal can say what holds the port without a second call
# into ss or docker, which is the whole reason waku_die's messages in this
# file never say only "refused": an operator told just "port in use" goes and
# runs `ss` themselves. Silent on success, like the other six.
#
# ONE FUNCTION, NOT A waku_env_pair_ok/waku_env_pair_name PAIR, and that is
# deliberate: splitting the decision from the message would mean asking `ss`
# and `docker` twice for the same answer, and a container that stopped or
# started between the two calls would make the message describe a machine
# that no longer exists. Reading it once and deciding from that one read
# cannot disagree with itself.
#
# $@ is the list of ports to check, given as plain decimal strings (install.sh
# passes 80 443); each row `ss` reports for a port not in that list is
# ignored, so this can be called with one port in a test and both in
# install.sh without duplicating the logic.
#
# ONE PROCESS PER SOCKET IS ASSUMED. SO_REUSEPORT letting two processes share
# one listening socket is not a shape this deployment's Caddy, or the
# hand-built one it replaces, produces, so only one pid is read per row.

# THE COMMAND EACH PACKAGE PROVIDES, PAIRED WITH THE PACKAGE.
#
# A space-separated string of `command:package` rather than an array, because
# these files parse under bash 3.2 (see the header). The word splitting in the
# loops below is intentional; neither a command nor an Ubuntu package name
# contains a space.
#
# `zstd` IS INSTALLED AND IS NOT REQUIRED, and the difference is the point. The
# tar-and-zstd pipelines run INSIDE the services image, which installs its own;
# no script in hosted/deploy/ ever runs zstd on the host. Installing it keeps
# the package set this deployment has always had; putting it in the required
# list below would refuse an install over a command nothing runs, which is task
# F2's finding in a mirror.
WAKU_PACKAGES="jq:jq curl:curl restic:restic sqlite3:sqlite3 zstd:zstd docker:docker.io"

# Every command any script in hosted/deploy/ actually runs on the host.
#
# restic and sqlite3 are the two that matter: restic is first reached at 03:17
# inside a timer unit, and host sqlite3 is what backup.sh and restore.sh run to
# copy and integrity-check both platform databases. `timeout` bounds the
# repository probe; `flock` takes the staging lock; `find` runs the archive
# sweep; `install`, `sed` and `awk` render the systemd units and read config
# values back.
WAKU_REQUIRED_COMMANDS="docker jq curl restic sqlite3 flock find install sed awk timeout"

# The packages whose command is not on PATH, as one line. Empty means nothing
# to install.
#
# ONE PROBE PER PACKAGE, AND ONLY THE MISSING ONES ARE NAMED. The earlier shape
# probed jq, curl and docker and then installed all seven or none, so a host
# that already had those three -- the ordinary shape of a machine somebody has
# been running something on -- never got restic, sqlite3 or zstd and the
# installer exited 0.
#
# INSTALLING ONLY WHAT IS MISSING ALSO STOPS THIS BREAKING A WORKING HOST. A
# machine running Docker CE has the daemon and the compose plugin from Docker's
# own packages, and `apt-get install docker.io` on it is a conflict over the
# daemon this deployment needs. A missing restic must not drag docker.io in
# behind it.
#
# THE COMPOSE PLUGIN IS NOT A BINARY ON PATH, so it is probed by asking docker
# for it. `command -v docker-compose` would answer for the retired v1 script and
# miss the plugin every supported install actually has.
#
# BUILDX IS THE SAME SHAPE, ONE COMMAND OVER: `docker buildx version` and not
# `command -v buildx`, because buildx is a docker SUBCOMMAND, not a binary
# either. Ubuntu's docker.io ships without it -- only Docker CE bundles it as
# docker-buildx-plugin -- so a host that got docker.io from this very install
# still needs the separate docker-buildx package. hosted/image/build.sh sets
# DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 because the per-Dockerfile ignore files that keep secrets
# out of the build context are a BuildKit feature; without buildx, BuildKit is
# not there to provide it, and the build dies mid-deployment instead of here.

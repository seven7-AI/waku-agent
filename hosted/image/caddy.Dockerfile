# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
# Caddy with exactly one caddy-dns module, named at build time.
#
# The stock caddy image has no DNS provider compiled in, and DNS-01 is the only
# challenge that can issue a WILDCARD certificate -- which is what one origin
# per tenant needs, because a tenant id becomes a DNS label.
#
# DNS_PROVIDER_VERSION IS EMPTY BY DEFAULT AND SHOULD NOT STAY THAT WAY on a
# deployment anybody depends on. With no version, xcaddy resolves the module's
# latest release on the day it builds, so two builds of the same commit produce
# two different Caddys -- and install.sh rebuilds this image on every run.
# install.sh's --dns-module-version passes a Go module suffix, for example
# "@v1.6.2", and logs a NOTE when it is absent.
# 2.10.0's builder ships Go 1.24.6, and NOTHING BUILDS AGAINST IT any more.
# Measured on a real VM, 2026-09-27: caddy-dns/route53@v1.5.x needs libdns
# v0.2.2, whose Record is a struct, while Caddy 2.10 pulls libdns v1, whose
# Record is an interface -- 40 compile errors. And every v1.6.x declares
# `go 1.25.0`, which 1.24.6 refuses outright. The pin was written to make
# builds reproducible and had quietly become a pin on a version that cannot
# build. 2.10.2's builder is Go 1.26.0, which both halves accept.

# QUOTED. Both ARGs are substituted by the shell this RUN starts, so an
# unquoted expansion would let a value with a space or a metacharacter in it
# become extra words in the command. install.sh keeps both to closed sets --
# DNS_PROVIDER is the module name alone, lowercase letters, digits and
# hyphens, and DNS_PROVIDER_VERSION is "@" and a Go version suffix -- and
# this is the second half of that, at the place the value is used.

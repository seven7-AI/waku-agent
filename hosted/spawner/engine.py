"""The Docker Engine API over its Unix socket, with aiohttp.

No Docker SDK (spec, "The spawner"). The API surface the spawner needs is nine
calls, and a library for nine calls is a dependency, a version to track and a
second way to express the container template.

aiohttp appears here and nowhere else in hosted/spawner/: the spec keeps it in
"the outermost HTTP layer", and for the spawner this is that layer -- the
service's own front door is a Unix socket speaking one JSON object per line
(hosted/jsonsock.py), not HTTP.

    A container started WITH a TTY gets an unframed stream, and so does a

    so it checks the shape of each frame before trusting it -- a valid header
    is a stream byte in 0..2, three zero bytes, and a length that does not run
    off the end. The first byte that fails that test ends the framed reading
    and the rest is returned as-is, so unframed output is never mangled and a
    truncated stream is never silently dropped.

    Both streams are interleaved in the order the daemon sent them, because
    that is the order they happened; nothing here needs to tell stdout from
    stderr, and a caller that did would want the frames, not this.

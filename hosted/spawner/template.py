"""The one shape every container the spawner creates has.

NO BRANCHES AND NO OPTIONS, on purpose. The spec calls this "one template", and
a template with a flag is two templates that agree today. Every isolation
property a tenant container has -- the read-only root, CapDrop ALL,
no-new-privileges, the seccomp profile, the pids limit, the memory and CPU
caps, the oom_score_adj, the log driver, AutoRemove -- is set here, once, in a
function whose output a test can read without a Docker daemon.

WHAT THE OFFLINE TEST PROVES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
test_container_template.py reads the dict this builds. That is a DRIFT CHECK:
it catches a dropped CapDrop the moment somebody drops it, offline, on every
PR. It does NOT prove the kernel honoured any of it. The guard is
evals/hosted_docker/test_isolation.py, which reads `docker inspect` on a
RUNNING container and then tries the thing the field is supposed to prevent.
Both exist and neither is the other.

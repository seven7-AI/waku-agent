"""DockerRuntime: the operations ports.TenantRuntime names, and no more.

The spawner is root with CAP_SYS_ADMIN and the data disk's block device. EVERY
NEW OPERATION HERE IS A NEW PRIVILEGED VERB, so this class implements exactly
the ones in the Protocol and exactly the five tasks core/requests.TASKS names.
`tenant_ids` made the Protocol six; the conformance test in
test_spawner_service.py counts them, so the number lives there and not here.
Widening either set is a spec change.

What each verb can and cannot do, so a reviewer can check the list rather than
the code:

  provision  creates two empty directories under the tenant root, sets their
             XFS project id and limit, hands them to UID 10001, and runs ONE
             throwaway container with no network and only those two mounts.
             It cannot touch any path outside <tenant_root>/<validated id>/,
             because tenant_dirs refuses anything that is not a tenant id.
  start      creates and starts ONE container, from the fixed template, at the
             address the project id derives. It cannot choose an image, a
             network, a mount, a capability or a user: every one of those is
             in template.py and none is a parameter.
  stop       stops the container labelled with this tenant id. It cannot stop
             a container it did not label.
  list       reads. It writes nothing.
  task       runs ONE throwaway container with a command from a five-entry
             table. The command is not a parameter: the caller names a task,
             and the table names the command.

# able to start a spawner on a machine with no XFS -- a maintainer's Docker
# Desktop, or the hosted-docker job's steps that run before the loop mount --
# and the alternative, letting an empty string mean the same thing, is how a
# misspelling in install.sh silently turns every tenant's disk limit off.

#
# exits 0. Not "fails with the sink's error" -- exits ZERO. _run_to_completion
# only raises on a non-zero exit, so without this line a restore that read
# nothing would have returned {"ok": True} over a tenant whose old tree had
# just been archived and removed, and a backup that copied nothing would have
# reported a path the operator would later restore from.
# test_spawner_restore.py::test_a_failing_source_fails_the_whole_pipeline drives
# these three constants through a real bash with `tar` stubbed on PATH.
#
# `sqlite3 .backup` is SQLite's ONLINE backup: it is safe against a live
# database, which a plain copy is not. The *-wal, *-shm and *-journal files are
# left out on purpose -- they belong to the live database and would corrupt the
# copy on restore -- and every other file is copied as-is, symlinks kept as
# symlinks, because restic stores a symlink as a symlink and never follows it.
# THE MANIFEST IS WRITTEN LAST AND REMOVED FIRST, and that ordering is the
# whole of GC-3. `mkdir -p /staging/home /staging/env` is line one, so both
# directories exist -- empty -- from the first instant of a backup, before the
# database copy and before either tar. Every guard that asked what staging
# LOOKED LIKE therefore accepted a backup that died after line one, and the
# restore then destroyed a live tenant and answered {"ok": True}.
#
# Shape cannot tell a finished backup from an interrupted one. So the backup
# DECLARES it: manifest.json is the last thing written, naming the parts it
# wrote and whether it copied a database. Removing any previous manifest FIRST
# is the other half -- without that, a second backup that died halfway would
# sit under the first backup's manifest, which would say this partial data is
# whole.
#
# AND THE PART DIRECTORIES ARE CLEARED, which is the same mistake one level up.
# `rm -f` took the old manifest and nothing took the old home/ and env/, so the
# manifest described THIS backup while the directories held the union of every
# backup ever taken. Two consequences, both silent: a file the tenant deleted
# came back on the next restore, and a manifest saying `state_db: false` sitting
# above an earlier backup's home/state.db restored a database it says was never
# copied -- after archiving and wiping the live tree, answering {"ok": True}.
# A fact derived from the wrong source, for the fifth time in this file.
#
# It costs nothing that is still worth having: the `rm -f` on the line above
# has already made the previous backup unrestorable.
#
# `find -delete` and not `rm -rf`: -delete implies -depth, traverses
# FTS_PHYSICAL and unlinks relative to a directory fd it opened itself, so a
# symlink among a tenant's backed-up files is removed as a link and never
# descended. `-mindepth 1` keeps the two directories themselves. The same

        project quota, and only then copy in.

        Packing and removing matters: a moved directory keeps its XFS project
        id, so an old tree left on disk would keep counting against the
        tenant's quota. The project id is never reused, so the tombstone in
        control.db stays; nothing here frees or reclaims one.

        THE PROJECT ID COMES FROM THE CALLER, and there is no other place it
        could come from. An earlier draft called a `_project_id_of(tenant_id)`
        helper, which cannot be written: `task` carried no project id, the two
        directories have just been removed so there is no inode left to read it
        off, and the spawner may not open control.db. Inventing one instead
        would give the restored tenant a new XFS accounting bucket AND a new
        fixed bridge address, which breaks the one claim the fixed-address
        scheme rests on -- that a stale address in the gateway's memory "can
        only reach nothing or the same tenant".

        BOTH DIRECTORIES ARE REMOVED IN ONE CONTAINER RUN, and the reason is
        C2-1. template.task_container binds BOTH tenant paths unconditionally,
        and the Docker daemon creates a missing `Binds` source as a root-owned
        directory -- the documented behaviour of the legacy bind form and the
        reason `--mount` exists. So removing them one per run cannot work: the
        second run's create re-makes the first's directory, behind provision's
        back, and provision then takes its FileExistsError branch and calls
        set_limit instead of claim. That directory keeps XFS project 0 --
        uncounted and unlimited -- for the rest of that tenant's life, while
        the other one is fine and the asymmetry is invisible. A tenant who got
        a restore could then fill the shared data disk and stop every other
        tenant on the VM.

        So: one run empties both mounts, the host then removes both, and
        nothing binds either path again until provision() has re-created them.
        Its create path runs for BOTH, and `claim()` sets the project id on two
        empty directories -- the only place in this class where `project -s`
        runs, on exactly what the spec describes. The check below is what makes
        a future regression loud instead of silent.

        NOTHING HERE STOPS A RUNNING TENANT CONTAINER, and F3's caller does:
        `_act` calls `launcher.stop(tenant.id)` before this task, and
        `restore.sh --all` stops the whole fleet through `stop-all` first. The
        sequencing belongs with the caller, which already has `stop` as a verb.
        What the caller CANNOT reach is a task or inspect container -- `stop`
        names a KIND_TENANT container and nothing else -- so those are refused
        here instead; see the first lines of the body.

        The same shape as every other task: a throwaway container, the services
        image, no network, the tenant's two mounts and the ONE extra the task
        needs -- the archive root, which is the platform's own directory and
        not any tenant's.

        IT REFUSES A BUSY TENANT, and that is not the same guard `_restore`
        already has: `_restore` calls `_refuse_if_busy` and then calls THIS,
        but `tenant.sh delete` reaches this method through the admin verb
        `delete`, which runs `archive` on its own and never went past that
        check. An inspect container is the one that bites -- it is
        operator-started, AutoRemove is deliberately off, and it lives until
        `inspect-stop`, so `launcher.stop` and `stop-all` both leave it
        running with `state.db` open. The archive it would then pack is the
        ONLY copy a deleted tenant has (backup.sh's own comment: archives are
        in no restic snapshot), so a torn database here is not recoverable
        from anywhere. Refusing costs the operator one `tenant.sh
        inspect-stop`; the admin verb has already set the tenant's status to
        disabled by this point, which `tenant.sh enable` reverses.

        The double call on the restore path is deliberate and free: the query
        is one label lookup and nothing between the two creates a blocking
        container.

        ENOTEMPTY, and it fails loudly rather than falling back to a recursive
        remove. If `find` fails for any reason, `bash -euc` exits non-zero,
        _run_to_completion raises, and the host never reaches rmdir at all.

"""The only writer of the fleet: tenant rows, proxy tokens, containers.

THREE THINGS LIVE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, and each has a reason that is a bug
somebody would otherwise ship:

  the token issue     ControlDb.issue_token REVOKES the tenant's previous
                      token in the same transaction. Two call sites means the
                      second one silently 401s a container the first one
                      started, and the tenant sees their free tier stop
                      working with nothing in any log to say why.
  the address book    the gateway forwards to an address it remembers. A
                      second dict of addresses is a second answer to "where is
                      this tenant", and the stale one is the one that gets
                      used, because the fresh one belongs to whichever handler
                      just ran.
  the maintenance mark  it has to be checked before a start and set before a
                      task, and the spec's rule is that no container starts
                      while it is set. A mark one handler sets and another
                      forgets to read is not a mark.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It makes no admission decision: `Fleet.admit` does
that, in hosted/core/idle.py, on an injected clock, and group B tested it
there. `Launcher` calls `Fleet` and the spawner; it does not re-derive what
they already decide. The one place it looks like it decides something is
`resync`, which refuses to adopt a container at an address no project id
derives -- and that is a refusal, not a decision.

        against the platform's own key, so a disabled tenant, a deleted tenant
        and a tenant under maintenance must not be issued one even if the
        start that follows would have failed anyway. The order is: status,
        maintenance, then issue.

        MAINTENANCE IS CHECKED TWICE: once here, before a second caller waits
        on the lock at all, so the common case fails fast without contending
        for it; and again just inside the lock, because a mark can land while
        a second caller is queued on `await lock.acquire()` -- the first
        check ran before the mark existed, and without the second one this
        caller would resume holding the lock with a now-stale answer and
        issue a token for a tenant a task, backup, restore or archive
        already owns. The spawner's own `busy` answer is still the real
        backstop (the mark is enforced there so it survives a gateway
        restart), so what the second check narrows is a token issue, not a
        container start reaching a held tenant.

        A FAILED START DOES NOT REVOKE THE TOKEN IT ISSUED, and that is
        deliberate. `start` can fail after the spawner has already created the
        container -- a timeout on the socket read, a gateway restart mid-call
        -- and revoking then would 401 the model calls of a container that is
        up and serving its tenant. The next successful start issues a new
        token, which revokes this one in the same transaction, and `stop`
        revokes unconditionally. The window is one container's lifetime, the
        token is bound to one tenant, and the alternative breaks a working

        t3.large that number is derived from memory, and the failure mode of
        exceeding it is the kernel OOM-killing somebody's container mid-turn:
        a running tenant's work destroyed by a stranger signing in. A cap one
        entry point ignores is not a cap.

        idle sweep, a restore, a delete. On this branch that means it is
        repaired at gateway startup, on a refused connection, and on
        `restart-all`; the once-a-minute sweep that would also call this is
        E4's and E4 is deferred.

        THE ADDRESS IS CHECKED AGAINST THE PROJECT ID. DockerRuntime.list
        already refuses an address outside the tenant subnet, and this is the
        stronger check it says it cannot make: here the tenant row is
        available, so the address can be required to be the one THAT tenant's
        project id derives. With C3 deferred there is no firewall on the
        bridge, so a container somebody else placed there is not a hypothetical
        -- and a container at a tenant's address that is not that tenant's
        container is an unauthenticated dashboard the gateway would forward a
        signed-in person to.

"""The gateway's HTTP surface: one catch-all, two hosts, one forwarder.

ONE CATCH-ALL ROUTE, AND THE ROUTER IS NOT USED. aiohttp matches on the
DECODED path, so a handler registered for "/api/chat/stream" also answers
"/api/ch%61t/stream" -- and hosted/core/policy.path_refusal, whose whole job
is to refuse a path carrying a percent sign before anything matches it, would
never run. Measured on aiohttp 3.14.1: with a single add_route("*",
"/{tail:.*}"), request.raw_path is byte-for-byte what was on the wire, for
"//api/chat/stream", "/api/ch%61t/stream", "/api/../x" and "/api%2fsettings"
alike. So there is one route, and this module does the matching.

THE FORWARDER IS A CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENT, NOT A PORT. hosted/ports/__init__.py
is explicit that there are four seams and a fifth Protocol means somebody is
abstracting over a choice made once. `forward` is a plain callable with
exactly one implementation (hosted/gateway/forward.py, task E3), and it is
REQUIRED: there is no default, so a Gateway cannot be built without one, and
until E3 lands there is no hosted/gateway/__main__.py to build one from.

WHAT RUNS BEFORE THE HOST IS EVEN LOOKED AT. Path hygiene and the
Service-Worker refusal run on every request to either host. The spec puts
path hygiene inside route policy, which is a tenant-host concern; running it
first is a strengthening, and it is deliberate: the apex's routes are matched
by exact string, and "/%6cogin" matching nothing and answering 404 is a
worse answer than 400 for the same reason "/api/ch%61t/stream" is.

# Supabase or this page wrote survives for the next person at this browser.
# "cache" clears the HTTP cache for this origin -- which on the apex holds
# four stylesheets, three fonts, the Waku mark and a 2.5 KB script, all of
# them public, identical for every visitor, and none of them a credential.
#
# It cost 113591 bytes on EVERY sign-in, measured against the live
# deployment: ten requests, zero cache hits, 88 KB of it incompressible
# woff2, on every visit forever. That is the whole of what "cache" bought
# and the whole of what it cost.
#

# this header "carries no cookies", because the session cookie is cleared by
# the logout that sends this, not by the browser.
# --- the public static files, and the ONE place they are allowed to cache ---
#
# WHY THESE AND NOTHING ELSE. answers.harden sends `Cache-Control: no-store`
# on every response, which is right for what the spec's acceptance 14 names:
# "every CONTAINER response carries Cache-Control: no-store". A tenant's
# dashboard data is theirs and must never sit in a shared cache.
#
# /auth/static/ is the opposite kind of thing. Every byte is public, identical
# for every visitor, and carries no credential: four stylesheets, three fonts,
# the Waku mark and the sign-in script. `no-store` on those bought nothing and
# cost 113591 bytes per sign-in.
#
# REVALIDATION AND NOT A LIFETIME, on purpose. `no-cache` means "you may keep
# it, ask me before using it". The browser sends the tag it holds and an
# unchanged file answers 304 with no body -- so a repeat visit costs round
# trips instead of bytes, and a deploy is picked up IMMEDIATELY. A max-age
# would be faster and would serve the previous release's stylesheet to
# somebody signing in after a deploy, which on the page that holds a
# credential is not a trade worth a few hundred milliseconds.

        The one route on a tenant host served without a session, because it is
        how the session is made (spec, "Host check").

        THREE THINGS ARE CHECKED AND THE ANSWER IS THE SAME FOR ALL THREE.
        The navigation must not be cross-site, or an attacker mints a code on
        their own account and walks somebody else's browser into their
        container. The code must redeem. And the tenant it names must exist
        and be active -- `redeem` proves only that this gateway issued the
        code, and a tenant can be disabled between the sign-in and the
        hand-off, so without this the disable path rests entirely on
        `end_sessions` burning outstanding codes.

        FOR E3: do not turn on aiohttp's access log without filtering this
        route. Its default line would write `?code=<43 characters>` into the
        operator's log file, where it is a live hand-off for sixty seconds.

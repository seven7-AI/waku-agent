"""The gateway's HTTP surface: one catch-all, two hosts, one forwarder.

ONE CATCH-ALL ROUTE, AND THE ROUTER IS NOT USED. aiohttp matches on the
DECODED path, so a handler registered for "/api/chat/stream" also answers
"/api/ch%61t/stream" -- and hosted/core/policy.path_refusal, whose whole job
is to refuse a path carrying a percent sign before anything matches it, would
never run. Measured on aiohttp 3.14.1: with a single add_route("*",
"/{tail:.*}"), request.raw_path is byte-for-byte what was on the wire, for
"//api/chat/stream", "/api/ch%61t/stream", "/api/../x" and "/api%2fsettings"
alike. So there is one route, and this module does the matching.

THE FORWARDER IS A CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENT, NOT A PORT. hosted/ports/__init__.py
is explicit that there are four seams and a fifth Protocol means somebody is
abstracting over a choice made once. `forward` is a plain callable with
exactly one implementation (hosted/gateway/forward.py, task E3), and it is
REQUIRED: there is no default, so a Gateway cannot be built without one, and
until E3 lands there is no hosted/gateway/__main__.py to build one from.

WHAT RUNS BEFORE THE HOST IS EVEN LOOKED AT. Path hygiene and the
Service-Worker refusal run on every request to either host. The spec puts
path hygiene inside route policy, which is a tenant-host concern; running it
first is a strengthening, and it is deliberate: the apex's routes are matched
by exact string, and "/%6cogin" matching nothing and answering 404 is a
worse answer than 400 for the same reason "/api/ch%61t/stream" is.

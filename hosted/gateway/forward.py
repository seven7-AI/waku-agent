"""What crosses the boundary, in each direction, and what does not.

THIS MODULE MAKES NO DECISION GROUP B HAS NOT ALREADY MADE.
hosted/core/policy.decide returns the verdict, hosted/core/idle.Fleet.admit
returns the action, hosted/core/quota.allow_turn returns the refusal. Every
one of them is pure, on an injected clock, and tested without a server. What
is here is the part that has no pure-logic home: two header allowlists, a
socket, and the order the three decisions run in.

BOTH LISTS ARE ALLOWLISTS, AND THE DEFAULT IS ALWAYS TO DROP. A list of
forbidden headers loses the day somebody invents a new one -- which is what
Set-Cookie, Clear-Site-Data, Link rel=preload and Refresh all are, from the
point of view of whoever wrote the list before they existed. Measured on a
real BaseHTTPRequestHandler: a Set-Cookie the handler sends DOES arrive in
the client's headers, so this is a drop that happens, not a precaution.

THE CONTAINER IS HTTP/1.0. waku/ops/dashboard.py's Handler does not set
protocol_version, so every response is HTTP/1.0 and an SSE body is delimited
by the connection closing. aiohttp reads that as a stream and iter_any()
yields each flush separately, which is what makes the pass-through unbuffered
without any special case for it.

    answers one question only: whether the request may run past 120 seconds.

    EXACT PATH, NOT THE MATCHED ROUTE, and the asymmetry with is_a_turn below

    matched route) so it cannot be a free turn, and it is CAPPED at 120
    seconds (here, exact path) so it cannot hold a container awake forever.

    policy.STREAMING_ROUTES` leaves the whole suite green. It is kept because
    the day one of them is unblocked, a stream would otherwise be cut off at
    120 seconds with no line of code saying why. Measured, not assumed:

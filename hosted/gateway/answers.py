"""Every response the gateway writes itself, and the headers on all of them.

THE SENTENCES HERE ARE THE GATEWAY'S OWN. Every sentence a tenant can be shown
about their container comes from group B -- policy.PAUSED_BODY and its block
messages, idle.CAPACITY_MESSAGE, idle.START_TIMEOUT_MESSAGE,
idle.MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE, quota.TURN_LIMIT_MESSAGE. The ones below are about
the REQUEST rather than the container, they exist nowhere else, and none of
them carries a `code`: hosted/core/policy.CODES is a closed set with one
member, pinned against the dashboard's JavaScript by
test_paused_contract.py, and growing it needs a page change in another group.

HARDEN() IS APPLIED TO EVERY RESPONSE THIS PROCESS WRITES, including the ones
it copies from a container. It is a function and not a middleware because a
streaming response is prepared by its own handler and a middleware that runs
after prepare() cannot add a header to it.

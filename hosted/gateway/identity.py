"""Who is asking: a Supabase access token, verified against the project's JWKS.

THE SPEC'S `aud` SENTENCE IS WRONG FOR THIS PROJECT, and writing the verifier
to its letter would refuse every real sign-in. A real token from
upmikpuftlvvpwkvouqr carries:

    aud           https://api.waku.one/mcp      <- a CUSTOM audience
    role          authenticated                 <- what the spec calls `aud`
    iss           https://upmikpuftlvvpwkvouqr.supabase.co/auth/v1
    is_anonymous  False
    amr           otp

So the audience comes from configuration, defaulting to that value, and
`role == "authenticated"` is checked as its own claim. Both are enforced.

ONE AUDIENCE, NEVER A LIST -- ON BOTH SIDES. The configured audience is one
string: a list holding both the custom value and "authenticated" would accept
a token from any Supabase project that has not customised its audience,
leaving the issuer as the only thing doing work. The TOKEN's own `aud` is held
to one string too, which PyJWT does not do: it admits a token whose `aud` is a
list containing the configured value. This project mints a single string --
waku-memory's 0009_auth_hook.sql stamps one -- so the strict reading costs
nothing today and refuses a multi-audience token minted for somebody else that
happens to name us. If Supabase is ever configured to mint a list, THIS is the
line that has to change, and it will announce itself: every sign-in is refused
with "that token names more than one audience" in the log, which is a louder
failure than a quietly widened check.

ASYMMETRIC ALGORITHMS ONLY. ALGORITHMS holds ES256 and RS256 and no HS*: with
an HMAC algorithm admitted, a JWKS document's own public key bytes become a
valid signing secret, which is the oldest JWT confusion there is.

THE REFETCH IS RATE-LIMITED. An unknown `kid` is a reason to refetch the JWKS,
and `kid` comes from an unauthenticated request, so without a cooldown a
stream of tokens with random kids is a stream of outbound requests the
attacker chose the rate of.

`exp` AND `nbf` ARE CHECKED AGAINST THIS OBJECT'S CLOCK, not PyJWT's. PyJWT
reads time.time() directly and takes no clock, so a verifier built with an
injected clock -- which every other object in hosted/ takes, and which is how
this group's tests make time pass without sleeping -- would have one claim
judged by the fake clock and the expiry judged by the wall clock. `require`
still makes PyJWT refuse a token with no `exp` at all; what moved here is the
comparison, and with the default `now` it is the same comparison PyJWT makes.

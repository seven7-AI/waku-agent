"""ledger.db -- spend and platform-call times. The proxy's alone.

On the VM, ledger/ is owned by UID 10003 with mode 0700. The gateway never
opens this file: it reads spend over run/proxy/proxy.sock (internal.py), and
when that cannot answer it applies free's turn limit and /account says "Spend
is unavailable right now."

RESERVATIONS ARE AN AGGREGATE, not a row each, because that is what makes a
crash recoverable. The spec's spend table has one settled and one reserved
column per tenant per month; when the proxy starts, whatever is still reserved
is settled at its full amount, since the upstream call it was holding may
already have been billed. Per-reservation rows would have to be matched back
to calls that no longer exist.

Because reservations are an aggregate they are also FUNGIBLE: there is no
per-call identity to preserve, so releasing "0.40 of this tenant's outstanding
reservations" is well defined even when the month has turned over since the
reserve. That is what settle() and release() do, and it is what keeps a call in
flight at 00:00 UTC on the first from being billed twice -- see _release_locked.

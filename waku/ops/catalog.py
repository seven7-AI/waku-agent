"""The model catalog — what you can actually run, and the shortlist you curated.

Two related jobs, both feeding the settings model picker:

1. **What exists.** `list_models()` asks a provider what it can serve. There is
   no single way to ask: some endpoints publish an explicit catalog URL (kimi
   chats on the Anthropic wire but lists on its OpenAI-compatible one), most
   OpenAI-compatible endpoints answer `GET {base_url}/models`, and some — the
   Anthropic wire among them — have no listing at all, so we fall back to that
   provider's own known defaults. Cached 5 minutes; failures are cached ~1
   minute WITH the reason, so an unreachable catalog can't stall the
   dashboard's 5-second poll and still tells you why.

2. **What you chose.** `.waku/models.json` holds an ordered `provider:model`
   shortlist. The chat switcher shows exactly these — the built-in defaults are
   a starting point, never the menu. The first pinned model for a provider is
   that provider's default when you switch to it.

Writing the shortlist lives here (`save_pinned`); the pin/unpin HTTP action
lives in settings_api, because its reply is a whole settings payload. That
keeps the dependency pointing one way: settings_api -> catalog, never back.

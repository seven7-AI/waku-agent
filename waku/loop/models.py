"""Model access — eight providers, one loop, zero framework.

The loop speaks one dialect: Anthropic's Messages shape (system/messages/tools
in, content blocks out). Providers plug in two ways:

  anthropic wire format (native)     → Anthropic, Kimi/Moonshot, GLM/Z.ai, MiniMax
  openai wire format (thin adapter)  → OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter

Pick with WAKU_PROVIDER=anthropic|openai|gemini|deepseek|minimax|kimi|glm|openrouter
and set that provider's API key in .env. Override the model ids with WAKU_MODEL /
WAKU_SMALL_MODEL if the defaults below age out — they're just strings. This
matters most for openrouter: it's a single key in front of hundreds of models,
so WAKU_MODEL=<vendor>/<model> (e.g. "google/gemini-3.5-flash") picks whichever
one you want — and its defaults below are $0 ":free" ids, so it works with no
spend at all (rate-limited). The dashboard Settings tab lists the live catalog.

    A model name belongs to the provider it was configured FOR. WAKU_MODEL and
